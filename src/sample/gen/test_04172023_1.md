Problem:

You are given an array of integers `nums`, where there are `n` integers in total. Your task is to find a contiguous subarray of `nums` that has the largest sum and return its sum.

Examples:

Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: The contiguous subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1

Input: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]
Output: 23

Tests:

```python
def test_max_subarray_sum():
    assert max_subarray_sum([-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]) == 6
    assert max_subarray_sum([1]) == 1
    assert max_subarray_sum([5,4,-1,7,8]) == 23
    assert max_subarray_sum([1,2,-1,3,4,-1]) == 9
    assert max_subarray_sum([-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]) == -1
```

Solution:

One possible solution to this problem is the Kadane's algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(n).

The idea behind this algorithm is to iterate through the array and at each iteration, update two variables: `current_max` and `global_max`. `current_max` keeps track of the maximum subarray sum that ends at the current index, and `global_max` keeps track of the maximum subarray sum seen so far.

At each iteration, we compare the current element with the sum of the current element and `current_max`. If the current element is greater, we update `current_max` with the current element, otherwise we update it with the sum. We then compare `current_max` with `global_max` and update it if `current_max` is greater.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def max_subarray_sum(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    current_max = global_max = nums[0]
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        current_max = max(nums[i], current_max + nums[i])
        global_max = max(global_max, current_max)
    return global_max
```
